[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Hello, I‚Äôm Anastasia, graduate student in Applied Mathematics \u0026amp; Bioinformatics at Peter the Great Polytechnical University, Saint-Petersburg. I adore statistics. Moreover, I love it rigorous (though, it hurts). Wait! I‚Äôm not a hardcore pure mathematician. I‚Äôm a person who struggles to understand all the tiny theoretical details \u0026amp; always has questions.\nI‚Äôve been teaching at Saint-Petersburg Electrotechnical University ‚ÄúLETI‚Äù for 3 years now. There are plenty of materials on statistics but usually they either lack rigor or clarity. As a self-learner, I get really distressed when struggling to read textbooks. I believe that unversity-level mathematics can be explained simpler without sacrificing the rigor.\nAs a researcher I am extremely willing to apply mathematics to real-world problems. Not just use common tools but get all the details of how everything works and why it works. Now I‚Äôm in bioinformatics. I used to work at Theodosius Dobzhansy Center for Genome Bioinformatics where did research for my Bachelor‚Äôs Thesis. It was devoted to construction of a combined statistics from multiple contingency tables in order to identify genomic regions associated with phenotypes in GWAS studies. Now I‚Äôm working on accurate imputation project as a part of research in SPbPU and also doing proteomics at Institute of Systems Biology \u0026amp; Medicine, Moscow.\n  Download my resum√©.\n","date":1607817600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1607817600,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"Hello, I‚Äôm Anastasia, graduate student in Applied Mathematics \u0026 Bioinformatics at Peter the Great Polytechnical University, Saint-Petersburg.
